# River Clean Robot

The River Clean Robot is a Python-based simulation of a robot designed to patrol a river, collect trash, and call for a dumper when its trash bin is full. This project provides a basic framework for the robot's operations, including movement, trash collection, and unloading the collected trash.

## Introduction
The River Clean Robot project simulates a river cleaning robot that can move forward, turn, collect trash, and call for a dumper when its trash bin is full. This project serves as an introductory example of robotic control using Python, showcasing basic movement and task automation.

## Features
- Move forward
- Turn left and right
- Detect and collect trash
- Call for a dumper to empty the trash bin when full

## Requirements
- Python 3.6 or higher

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/erpranjalmishra/sudoshift
    cd rcrmotions
    ```

2. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install any necessary dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt  # Currently, there are no external dependencies
    ```

## Usage
1. Run the script:
    ```bash
    python river_clean_robot.py
    ```

2. The script will simulate the robot's patrol and cleaning process, including moving, turning, collecting trash, and calling for a dumper when necessary.

### Example
Here's how you can use the `RiverCleanRobot` class in your own script:

```python
from river_clean_robot import RiverCleanRobot

robot = RiverCleanRobot(max_capacity=5)
robot.patrol_and_clean(10)  # Patrol and clean for 10 steps
robot.patrol_and_clean_with_turns(20)  # Patrol and clean for 20 steps with random turns

print(f"Total trash collected: {robot.trash_collected}")
```

## Code Explanation
The main code is contained in the `river_clean_robot.py` file. Below is an overview of the class and methods:

### `RiverCleanRobot` Class
- `__init__(self, max_capacity=10)`: Initializes the robot with a maximum trash capacity.
- `move_forward(self)`: Moves the robot forward.
- `turn_left(self)`: Turns the robot left.
- `turn_right(self)`: Turns the robot right.
- `collect_trash(self)`: Collects trash and increments the trash counter.
- `check_for_trash(self)`: Randomly determines if there is trash to collect.
- `call_dumper(self)`: Calls a dumper to empty the trash bin.
- `patrol_and_clean(self, steps)`: Patrols the river and cleans for a specified number of steps.
- `patrol_and_clean_with_turns(self, steps)`: Patrols the river with random turns and cleans for a specified number of steps.

## Future Enhancements
- Add obstacle detection and avoidance
- Implement GPS-based navigation
- Integrate with real hardware for actual river cleaning
- Enhance trash detection with computer vision
